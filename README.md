This repo includes the code for running some of the seminal papers on organizational learning under complexity.    

Currently, it includes the code for creating landscapes a l√° Levinthal (1997). The code is presented in two ways. The levinthal_create_landscape.ipynb introduces the logic used to create NK landscapes. The levinthal.ipynb replicates Dan's 1997 paper.  

The next code to be included is the myopic jump logic after that Csaszar and Levinthal (2016).

# log  

**191002:** Code 10x faster!, a.k.a never use np.random.choice.  
**191001:** Sped up from quadratic to linear time in N and K.  
**190930:** Separated the create landscape tutorial from the full Levinthal (1997) tutorial.  
**190929:** Optimized search procedure.  
**190927:** Included the search functionality. Still no myopia.  
**190916:** Added the landscape building functionality. Search is not working at the moment.
